We can develop the test scripts to validate whether the functionality is working fine or not. 
Still, execution results matter a lot because test scripts are only understandable by technical people.
If we talk about higher management or stakeholders or non-technical person, 
they don't care about the technical aspects of test scripts; they only care about execution results at the end.
